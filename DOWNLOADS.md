# Downloads

*We apologize to those using a **non-English Windows system** at the moment. Due to an issue with locale-specific directory names, the connector is currently only functional for English installations (this issue is tracked at https://github.com/GlitterWare/Passy/issues/47). If you are familiar with symbolic links, you may attempt creating a link to your documents directory with file name 'Documents' in your user folder in order to make use of the connector without waiting for a fix.*

***Windows installer users**: if you have already installed v1.5.0, please re-download the installer from https://github.com/GlitterWare/Passy/releases/latest and run it one more time. The installer script was now updated properly to include the components and functionality necessary for the connector to work. Thank you.*
