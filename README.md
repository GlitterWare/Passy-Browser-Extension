## Building

Passy Browser Extension is open-source, feel free to make modifications to it and build it yourself. We're always very glad to see people exploring our projects. ðŸ‘¥

1. [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Clone the repository or [get the source code from the latest Passy release](https://github.com/GlitterWare/Passy/releases/latest).
3. Run `./submodules/flutter/bin/flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit --csp --pwa-strategy=none --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_CANVASKIT_URL=/` to build Passy Browser Extension.
4. You can then find your build at `build/web` relative to the project root.
5. The default `manifest.json` is not Firefox compatible. If you wish to use your build for Firefox, remove it from the build folder and rename `manifest_firefox.json` to `manifest.json`.
